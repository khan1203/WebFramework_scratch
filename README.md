# Roob : Buidling Web Framework from scratch

Roob is a lightweight, experimental Python web framework inspired by Django and FastAPI.
It is being developed step by step for educational purposes, with a strong focus on understanding the internal architecture of modern web frameworks, including routing, request–response handling, middleware design, and WSGI concepts.

The project is built incrementally, with each phase pushed to the repository as development progresses. This phased approach emphasizes learning by implementation, clarity of design, and gradual evolution from core primitives to higher-level abstractions.

Roob is intended as:

- A learning-oriented framework for exploring web framework internals
- A practical exercise in Python backend engineering
- A reference for understanding how frameworks like Django and FastAPI work under the hood

The framework is not production-ready and is not intended to compete with established frameworks, but rather to serve as a structured learning and experimentation platform.

Development will continue iteratively, In shā’ Allāh, with increasing architectural depth and feature completeness.
